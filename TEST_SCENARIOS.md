## Test Scenario 2: Contract Generation (No Fallback)
**Objective**: Verify contract generation works on first attempt without falling back to templates

### Test Steps:
1. Stay in **Agent** mode
2. Type: `Contract: voting system for community proposals`
3. Wait for AI response
4. Check console logs for retry attempts
5. Try different contract types:
   - `Contract: escrow for multi-party transactions`
   - `Contract: token management with transfer controls`

### Expected Results:
- ‚úÖ Should generate complete TEAL v8 contract on first attempt
- ‚úÖ Contract should include `#pragma version 8`
- ‚úÖ Should have real functionality (not skeleton code)
- ‚úÖ Should include detailed comments
- ‚ùå Should NOT show "Smart Fallback" or "Backup System" messages
- ‚úÖ Console should show minimal retry attempts (max 2)

## Test Scenario 3: Agent Operations Display
**Objective**: Verify operations are always visible and positioned correctly

### Test Steps:
1. **First Prompt Test**:
   - Refresh page, select **Agent** mode
   - Check operations display BELOW the initial prompt
2. **Subsequent Prompts Test**:
   - Send first message: `Balance:`
   - Check operations display ABOVE the input box
   - Send another message: `Contract: simple voting`
   - Verify operations are still visible above input

### Expected Results:
- ‚úÖ Operations should appear below first prompt initially
- ‚úÖ Operations should appear above input box after first message
- ‚úÖ Operations should NEVER disappear in Agent mode
- ‚úÖ All 5 operations should be visible: Send, Contract, Balance, Swap, Pool

## Test Scenario 4: Text Overflow Prevention
**Objective**: Ensure AI responses don't overflow chat containers

### Test Steps:
1. Generate a long contract: `Contract: complex multi-signature wallet with voting, time locks, and emergency features`
2. Ask for a detailed explanation: `Explain Algorand consensus in detail`
3. Test with code blocks containing very long lines
4. Resize browser window to different widths

### Expected Results:
- ‚úÖ All text should stay within chat containers
- ‚úÖ Long code lines should wrap or scroll horizontally
- ‚úÖ No horizontal overflow on page
- ‚úÖ Text should be readable on mobile/narrow screens

## Test Scenario 5: Green Comment Highlighting
**Objective**: Verify comment lines are highlighted in green with "//" preserved

### Test Steps:
1. Generate contract with comments: `Contract: simple payment with detailed comments`
2. Look for lines starting with "//"
3. Check syntax highlighting in code blocks

### Expected Results:
- ‚úÖ Lines starting with "//" should be highlighted in green
- ‚úÖ "//" characters should be preserved (not removed)
- ‚úÖ Comments should have italic styling
- ‚úÖ Other syntax highlighting should work (keywords, strings, numbers)

## Test Scenario 6: Pool Recommendation System
**Objective**: Test AI-powered pool recommendations with different preferences

### Test Steps:
1. **Basic Pool Query**:
   - Type: `Pool:`
   - Should show preference guide

2. **Low Risk Preference**:
   - Type: `Pool: low risk, high liquidity, staking required`
   - Should recommend ALGO/USDC, ALGO/USDT

3. **High Risk Preference**:
   - Type: `Pool: high risk, high rewards`
   - Should recommend ALGO/DEFLY, ALGO/TINY

4. **Mixed Preferences**:
   - Type: `Pool: medium risk, staking, AKTA tokens`
   - Should filter accordingly

### Expected Results:
- ‚úÖ Should provide personalized recommendations
- ‚úÖ Should show pool details: liquidity, APR, risk level, staking options
- ‚úÖ Should explain why each pool is recommended
- ‚úÖ Should include real metrics (even if mock data)
- ‚úÖ Should handle invalid/no preferences gracefully

---

## Test Scenario 7: Swap-to-Pool Integration
**Objective**: Verify swap commands suggest pool opportunities

### Test Steps:
1. Type: `Swap: 100 USDC to ALGO`
2. Check if response includes pool suggestion
3. Try: `Swap: ALGO to DEFLY`
4. Verify pool recommendations appear

### Expected Results:
- ‚úÖ Swap quotes should include pool suggestions
- ‚úÖ Should say something like "Want to earn from this pair? Try Pool: USDC/ALGO"
- ‚úÖ Should maintain normal swap functionality
- ‚úÖ Pool suggestions should be relevant to the swap pair

---

## Test Scenario 8: Error Handling & Resilience
**Objective**: Test system behavior under error conditions

### Test Steps:
1. **Network Errors**:
   - Disconnect internet
   - Try balance command
   - Try pool recommendations

2. **Invalid Inputs**:
   - Type: `Contract:` (empty)
   - Type: `Pool: invalid preference xyz`
   - Type: `Balance:` with no wallet connected

3. **API Failures**:
   - Stop backend server
   - Test various commands

### Expected Results:
- ‚úÖ Should show user-friendly error messages
- ‚úÖ Should not crash the application
- ‚úÖ Should provide guidance on how to resolve issues
- ‚úÖ Should gracefully handle missing wallet connections

## Test Scenario 9: End-to-End Agent Workflow
**Objective**: Test complete user journey through multiple operations

### Test Steps:
1. Start in Agent mode
2. Check balance: `Balance:`
3. Get pool recommendations: `Pool: low risk, staking`
4. Check swap rates: `Swap: 50 ALGO to USDC`
5. Generate contract: `Contract: payment splitter`
6. Refine contract: `Contract: add time delays`

### Expected Results:
- ‚úÖ All operations should work seamlessly together
- ‚úÖ Operations should remain visible throughout
- ‚úÖ Context should be preserved between commands
- ‚úÖ No memory leaks or performance degradation
