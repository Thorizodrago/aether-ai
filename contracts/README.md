# Aether AI Smart Contracts
## Example Contracts for Agent Commands

This folder contains example smart contracts that correspond to each Aether AI Agent Command. These contracts demonstrate the underlying blockchain functionality that powers the AI assistant's capabilities.

## 📁 Contract Examples

### 1. **Send to Wallet** (`send_to_wallet.py`)
- **Agent Command**: `/send` → "Send to Wallet:"
- **Features**:
  - Multi-token support (ALGO, ASAs)
  - Automatic fee calculation
  - Transaction validation
  - Batch transfer support
  - User statistics tracking

### 2. **Get Balance** (`get_balance.py`)  
- **Agent Command**: `/getBalance` → "Get Balance:"
- **Features**:
  - Multi-asset balance tracking
  - Historical balance data
  - Portfolio value calculation
  - Yield tracking and analytics
  - Real-time balance updates

### 3. **Swap ALGO** (`swap_algo.py`)
- **Agent Commands**: `/swapAlgo`, `/buyAlgo`, `/sellAlgo`
- **Features**:
  - Automated Market Maker (AMM) integration
  - Slippage protection (1% default)
  - MEV resistance with group limits
  - Multi-operation support (swap/buy/sell)
  - Comprehensive user statistics

### 4. **Open DEX** (`open_dex.py`)
- **Agent Command**: `/openDEX` → "Open DEX:"
- **Features**:
  - Multi-DEX integration (Tinyman, AlgoFi, Pact)
  - Optimal route finding across platforms
  - Liquidity aggregation
  - Cross-DEX arbitrage detection
  - Unified trading interface

### 5. **Connect To Tinyman** (`connect_tinyman.py`)
- **Agent Command**: `/connectTinyman` → "Connect To Tinyman:"
- **Features**:
  - Deep Tinyman protocol integration
  - Advanced pool analytics
  - Impermanent loss calculation
  - Yield farming optimization
  - Multi-strategy execution

## 🚀 How It Works

Each contract corresponds to an Aether AI agent command:

```
User types: "Send to Wallet: 2LRQWIOXE2XRB452CFV3AU46RCWGLXADGXWMJADYZOEV4WKKDMVYBS3HEU"
    ↓
Agent processes the command locally or routes to blockchain
    ↓
Smart contract executes on-chain functionality
    ↓
User receives formatted response with transaction details
```

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### PyTeal Framework
These contracts are written using PyTeal, the Python framework for Algorand Smart Contracts. Key components:

- **Global State**: Contract-wide variables and settings
- **Local State**: User-specific data storage
- **Transaction Validation**: Input verification and security checks
- **Business Logic**: Core functionality for each operation
- **Event Logging**: Transaction history and analytics

### Integration with Aether AI
The contracts work seamlessly with the Aether AI assistant:

1. **Command Recognition**: AI recognizes agent commands like "Send to Wallet:"
2. **Parameter Extraction**: Extracts wallet addresses, amounts, tokens
3. **Contract Interaction**: Calls appropriate smart contract methods
4. **Response Formatting**: Returns user-friendly transaction status
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of edge cases and failures
